    ## Description

    Nebula's Fables is an interactive learning tool connecting constellations with their mythos. We have designed this application for those interested in space or mythology. With the help of the NASA public library API and the Wikipedia API we have brought you a search image to find images, descriptions and fun facts about the stars above.

    Users can freely use our NASA tab to search NASA's public library of images and read a small snippet from Wikipedia. Users with have to create an account under the signup tab to access other features of our application. Once they have created an account and have logged in they will be able to access our space directory. Our directory will provide the user with their favorite constellations, the stars they're made up of, and facts regarding the constellation and their mythos.

    We will have future updates to this application which will include an animated models of stars and constellations. Be sure to create an account to stay up to date.
